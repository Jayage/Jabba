## Project Overview
Jabba The Huck Mixed Ultimate Frisbee Club.
Ireland's longest running and most successful ultimate club is back in 2021 for a full season of mixed ultimate.

A link to the live website can be found [here](https://jayage.github.io/Jabba/)

## UX
### User Stories

- As a user I want to, find out more about the club.
- As a user I want to, be able to view the website on various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- As a user I want to, find out who to contact with any queries regarding the club.
- As a user I want to, find out more about the leadership of the club.

### 1. Strategy

- Create a website that showcases the Ultimate Frisbee club team, Jabba the Huck
- Create an enjoyable and easy to use website.

### 2. Scope

- Fits in with my current skill-set of HTML & CSS
- Easy to 

### 3. Structure

As the website was built on being a single page with multiple sections. The nav bar when any option is selected will scroll down to the relevant part of the website. 
While the user doesn't have to scroll back to the top each time they want to see the top of the page thanks to a back to the top button that was implemented.

### 4. Skeleton

### 5. Surface
The overall UX is clean and similar in all pages to keep consistency.

### Colors:
The base color **vivid Sky Blue(#66C7F4)** was chosen from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). Some different colour tones were 
also chosen to make the website more elegant.

## Deployment
### This project has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

- All code was written on Gitpod, an online IDE.
- The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/Jayage/Jabba).
- Under the settings section of the GitHub repository, scrolled down to GitHub Pages section.
- Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.
- Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site url.
- There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
- The code can be run locally through clone or download.
- You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
- The Clone option provides a url, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
- The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.

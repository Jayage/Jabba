## UX
* My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist design.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap


## Strategy

The Jabba The Huck website is for users that want to learn more about the Jabba the Huck Ultimate Frisbee Team. 

#### As a user I want to:
* know more about what ultimate frisbee is.
* find out more about the clubs history.
* be able to view the website on various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* find out who to contact with any queries regarding the club.
* find out more about the leadership of the club.
* be able to instinctively navigate the website to efficiently find any information required.

## Deployment
### This project has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

* All code was written on Gitpod, an online IDE.
* The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/Jayage/Jabba).
* Under the settings section of the GitHub repository, scrolled down to GitHub Pages section.
* Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.
* Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site url.
* There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
* The code can be run locally through clone or download.
* You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
* The Clone option provides a url, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
* The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.
